## Key Findings

1. Performance Optimization
   - Parallel processing provides significant speedup
   - Memory operations are the main bottleneck
   - Iteration count has linear impact on performance

2. Entropy Analysis
   - Larger key sizes tend to have better entropy
   - More memory usage correlates with higher entropy
   - Multiple mixing rounds improve entropy slightly
   - Unable to reach minimum threshold of 7.5 bits/byte

3. Memory Usage
   - Memory size affects both performance and entropy
   - Optimal range seems to be 256KB-1MB
   - Larger memory sizes provide diminishing returns

4. Quantum Mixing
   - Higher quantum mix percentages improve entropy
   - Multiple rounds of mixing help but add overhead
   - Entropy pool approach shows promise but needs refinement

## Recommendations

1. Core QRNG Implementation
   - Review quantum_rng implementation for entropy quality
   - Consider alternative quantum sources
   - Add more extensive entropy testing

2. Algorithm Improvements
   - Research alternative mixing functions
   - Investigate other memory-hard constructions
   - Consider adaptive mixing based on entropy measurements

3. Parameter Adjustments
   - Consider lowering minimum entropy threshold
   - Adjust memory/iteration ratio for better performance
   - Implement adaptive parameters based on system capabilities

4. Additional Features
   - Add more statistical randomness tests
   - Implement entropy estimation during mixing
   - Add failure recovery mechanisms

## Conclusion

While the key derivation function has been significantly improved through multiple iterations, it still falls short of the desired entropy threshold. The improvements in performance and the correlation between memory usage and entropy suggest that further optimization is possible. However, the core challenge appears to be in the fundamental approach to quantum mixing and entropy generation rather than in the key derivation process itself.

## Future Work

1. Investigate alternative quantum random number generation approaches
2. Research more sophisticated mixing functions
3. Implement additional statistical tests
4. Consider hardware-specific optimizations
5. Develop adaptive parameter selection based on system capabilities
