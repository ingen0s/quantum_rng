# Monte Carlo Simulation Analysis

## Overview

The Monte Carlo simulation implementation provides a robust tool for financial asset price modeling using quantum random number generation. It simulates potential future price paths of financial assets using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which is widely used in financial mathematics for modeling stock prices and other assets.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Random Number Generation**
   - Uses quantum random number generation via the quantum_rng library
   - Implements Box-Muller transform for generating normally distributed random numbers
   - Ensures high-quality randomness for accurate simulations

2. **Price Path Simulation**
   - Implements Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model
   - Accounts for risk-free rate, dividend yield, and volatility
   - Uses daily time steps (configurable trading days)

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Calculates mean price and standard deviation
   - Tracks minimum and maximum prices
   - Computes confidence intervals (95% or 99%)
   - Provides coefficient of variation for volatility analysis

### Configuration Options

- Number of simulations (1,000 to 10,000,000)
- Trading days (default: 252 trading days per year)
- Initial price
- Volatility
- Risk-free rate
- Dividend yield
- Random seed
- Confidence level (95% or 99%)

### Output Formats

1. **Normal Output**
   - Mean final price
   - Standard deviation
   - Confidence interval

2. **Verbose Output**
   - All normal output plus:
   - Minimum and maximum prices
   - Coefficient of variation

3. **JSON Output**
   - Structured format with configuration and results

4. **CSV Output**
   - Individual simulation results
   - Ideal for detailed statistical analysis
   - Compatible with spreadsheet software

## Key Features

1. **Flexibility**
   - Configurable parameters for different market conditions
   - Multiple output formats for various use cases
   - Support for file output and progress monitoring

2. **Statistical Robustness**
   - Confidence interval calculations
   - Comprehensive statistical metrics
   - Large-scale simulation support

3. **User Interface**
   - Progress bar for long simulations
   - Clear error messages

### Edge Cases

1. **High Volatility**
   - Demonstrates wider price distributions
   - Shows increased standard deviation
   - Maintains mathematical consistency with GBM model
   - Properly handles extreme price movements

2. **Simulation Scale**
   - Handles minimum simulation count (1,000) with appropriate statistical validity
   - Scales efficiently to maximum simulation count (10,000,000)
   - Maintains numerical stability across simulation sizes
   - Adjusts confidence intervals appropriately based on sample size

3. **Price Ranges**
   - Handles both small and large initial prices
   - Maintains proportional relationships in outputs
   - Preserves statistical properties across price scales
   - Properly handles price boundaries (never goes below zero)

### Statistical Validation
- Normal distribution of returns confirmed
- Confidence intervals contain true mean
- Volatility scaling behaves correctly
- Statistical moments align with theoretical expectations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Price Simulation
```bash
./monte_carlo -n 10000 -p 50.0 -v 0.3
```

### High-Precision Analysis
```bash
./monte_carlo -n 100000 -p 50.0 -v 0.3 -V -C 99
```

### Data Export for Analysis
```bash
