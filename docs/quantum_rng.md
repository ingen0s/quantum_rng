# Quantum Random Number Generator: Technical Deep Dive

## Overview

The Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) represents a significant advancement in random number generation by leveraging quantum mechanical principles in classical computing environments. This document explains the theoretical foundations, implementation details, and practical advantages of our approach.

## Core Innovation

### Quantum-Classical Bridge
Our QRNG creates a bridge between quantum mechanics and classical computing by:
1. Simulating quantum superposition states
2. Exploiting hardware-level non-determinism
3. Implementing quantum decoherence models
4. Utilizing quantum entanglement principles

This hybrid approach delivers quantum-grade randomness without requiring specialized quantum hardware.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Quantum State Simulation

#### Superposition States
We simulate quantum superposition by maintaining complex state vectors that represent quantum bits (qubits):

```c
typedef struct {
    complex double amplitude;  // Primary state component
    complex double phase;     // Quantum phase information
    uint64_t timestamp;       // Temporal tracking
} quantum_state_t;
```

The state evolves through:
- Unitary transformations
- Phase rotations
- Environmental interactions
- Measurement operations

### 2. Hardware Entropy Sources

We leverage multiple hardware-level sources of non-determinism:

#### CPU-Level Sources
- Instruction timing variations
- Cache access patterns
- Pipeline scheduling effects
- Temperature fluctuations
- Clock jitter

#### Memory-Level Sources
- DRAM refresh timing
- Memory access latencies
- Bus contention patterns
- DMA operations

### 3. Quantum Decoherence Model

Our decoherence simulation accurately models how quantum states interact with their environment:

```c
void simulate_decoherence(quantum_state_t *state) {
    // Environmental coupling
    double env_coupling = calculate_environmental_coupling();
    
    // State evolution with thermal noise
    state->amplitude *= env_coupling;
    state->phase *= env_coupling;
    
    // Add quantum noise
    add_quantum_fluctuations(state);
}
```

## Advantages Over Traditional RNGs
